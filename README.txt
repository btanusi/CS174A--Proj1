My arms and legs are made up of cylinders, with spheres for joints. The back legs have 4 segments and 2 joints, the front legs have 3 segments and 1 joint, the arms have 3 segments and 3 joints. They are linked together accordingly.
The arms, legs, and body move in a sinusoidal motion. I used multiple google images and slow motion videos of horses and humans moving to replicate a natural horse motion and human motion. The centaur also travels in a circle.
The 0 key will display a pose similar to that of dancing stallions that professor mentioned. The 1 key will display the centaur with hind legs raised, and the 2 key will display the centaur with front legs raised. The 3 key will animate the centaur--it will appear to be galloping in a circle around the floor. The animation includes movement from every segment of the arms and the legs, and x-y-z rotation in the arms. The 4 key will provide a small sphere of where the left hind leg camera will sit.
Again, I used google images as inspiration and reference for all movement and poses.
I added arms and spherical joints for my creative portion, and added a texture to my sphere.
